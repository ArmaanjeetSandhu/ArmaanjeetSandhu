Made it to the end? Read these jokes I came up with:

<details>
<summary>Who solved the mystery of concurrency control?</summary>
It was Shared-Lock Holmes!  <br>
  <sub><i><b>Explanation:</b> Shared locks are used in concurrency control to allow multiple transactions to read a resource simultaneously while preventing any of them from writing to it, ensuring data consistency.</i></sub>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Why did the multi-armed bandit fail to rob the bank?</summary>
Because he was n-armed (unarmed)!  <br>
  <sub><i><b>Explanation:</b> The n-armed bandit problem is a classic dilemma in reinforcement learning where an agent must decide which arm of a multi-armed bandit to pull to maximize cumulative rewards over time, while facing uncertainty about each arm's reward distribution.</i></sub>
